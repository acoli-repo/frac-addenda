:apply-v a ontolex:LexicalEntry.

:equally-adv a ontolex:LexicalEntry.

:apply-equally a frac:Collocation:

rdf:_1^[a] :apply-v, rdf:_2 :equally-adv.

(Same procedure with "apply to")

What do we do with "the same applies"?

:the_same_applies a frac:Collocation;    (?)

rdf:_1 :the-dt, rdf:_2 :same-pron, rdf:_3 :apply-form-sg. (???)

Same situation as in the previous example BUT here we have two differentiated
sets (attempt to, try to) and (be difficult to, be impossible to). Do we want
to somehow “keep” those two sets differentiated?

Here the “Verb + analyse” tells us the order of the rdf container.
